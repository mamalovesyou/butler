            This PR was created in response to a manual trigger of the release workflow [here](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
            This is a new release: v${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
            I've updated the changelog and bumped the versions in the manifest files in this commit: ${{ steps.make-commit.outputs.commit }}.
            Merging this PR will create a GitHub release, upload all artifacts created as part of the release build and create a new deployment.
